# Offline_evaluation_in_recommenderSystems

**What is the impact of data leakage in recommendation? Are we expecting better recommendation accuracy by using more “future data” in training? 
To what extent can we compare model performance if data leakage exists in offline evaluation?**

Mainly we focused on the impact of data leakage on Recommender Systems accuracy.


We reproduced the results that were implemented by:

Yitong Ji, Aixin Sun, Jie Zhang, Chenliang Li (2020). [A Critical Study on Data Leakage in Recommender System Offline Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11060#:~:text=In%20academic%20research%2C%20recommender%20models%20are%20often%20evaluated%20on%20offline%20datasets.&text=Many%20such%20offline%20evaluations%20ignore,value%2C%20making%20the%20evaluation%20unrealistic.).

They adopted the implementation from the authors Xiangnan He, Lizi Liao, Hanwang Zhang, Liqiang Nie, Xia Hu and Tat-Seng Chua (2017) Neural Collaborative Filtering [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05031), [github](https://github.com/hexiangnan/) and verified that the code is able to reproduce the results in the original paper if following their experimental settings.
