impact of data leakage on Recommender Systems


We reproduced the results that were implemented by:

Yitong Ji, Aixin Sun, Jie Zhang, Chenliang Li (2020). [A Critical Study on Data Leakage in Recommender System Offline Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11060#:~:text=In%20academic%20research%2C%20recommender%20models%20are%20often%20evaluated%20on%20offline%20datasets.&text=Many%20such%20offline%20evaluations%20ignore,value%2C%20making%20the%20evaluation%20unrealistic.).

They adopted the implementation from the authors Xiangnan He, Lizi Liao, Hanwang Zhang, Liqiang Nie, Xia Hu and Tat-Seng Chua (2017) Neural Collaborative Filtering [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05031), [github](https://github.com/hexiangnan/) and verified that the code is able to reproduce the results in the original paper if following their experimental settings.
